# libimgui-render-opengl3 - Dear ImGui renderer backend for OpenGL 3

This is a `build2` package for the [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
OpenGL 3(+) renderer backend, built from its `docking` branch. It renders
`libimgui` draw data using OpenGL, resolving all entry points itself at
runtime (a bundled loader), with no extra dependency. A platform backend
(for example `libimgui-platform-glfw`) is also needed.
The public headers are `<backends/imgui_impl_opengl3.h>` and
`<backends/imgui_impl_opengl3_loader.h>`.
`#include "imgui_impl_opengl3.h"` also works.
The loader header is installed so a consumer can call through the same
loader this backend was compiled with. `imgl3wGetProcAddress` and
`imgl3wProcs` are exported for that. The proc-table layout is upstream's
generated loader, not a separately stable interface. Upstream says the
header is only for `imgui_impl_opengl3.cpp`. For a shared build with MSVC,
consumers also get `GL3W_API` defined as `__declspec(dllimport)`, which
also applies to a separate gl3w loader using the same macro.


## Usage

To start using `libimgui-render-opengl3` in your project, add the following `depends`
value to your `manifest`, adjusting the version constraint as appropriate:

```
depends: libimgui-render-opengl3 ^1.92.9
```

Then import the library in your `buildfile`:

```
import libs = libimgui-render-opengl3%lib{imgui-render-opengl3}
```


## Importable targets

This package provides the following importable targets:

```
lib{imgui-render-opengl3}
```


## Configuration variables

This package provides no configuration variables.
