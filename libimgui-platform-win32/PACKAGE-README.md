# libimgui-platform-win32 - Dear ImGui platform backend for native Win32

This is a `build2` package for the [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
native Win32 platform (input/window) backend, built from its `docking`
branch. It handles mouse, keyboard, and window input for `libimgui` using
the Windows API directly, with no extra dependency. A renderer backend
(for example `libimgui-render-dx12`) is also needed.
The public header is `<imgui/backends/imgui_impl_win32.h>`.
`#include <backends/imgui_impl_win32.h>` and `#include "imgui_impl_win32.h"` also work.

This package is Windows-only.
