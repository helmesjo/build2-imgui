# libimgui-platform-osx-examples - Dear ImGui platform backend for native macOS (examples)

This is a `build2` package containing the example for the
[Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) native macOS platform
backend, built from its `docking` branch: `example_apple_metal`,
unmodified from upstream. Its executable is named `example-osx-metal`
rather than upstream's own `example_apple_metal` to avoid clashing with
`libimgui-platform-glfw-examples`'s own `example-metal` in a shared
install prefix.

Upstream's own README for this example notes it predates the current
Cocoa/Metal integration conventions used by the other examples and
suggests `example_glfw_metal` or `example_sdl2_metal` for a more portable
starting point.
